# Memory Bank: Graph Analysis Plugin

## Overview
This memory bank contains comprehensive documentation for the Graph Analysis Obsidian plugin, a mature project (v0.15.4) that enhances Obsidian with advanced graph analysis capabilities.

## Memory Bank Structure

### Core Files
1. **[projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)** - Foundation document defining the plugin's core mission and identity
2. **[productContext.md](./productContext.md)** - Why the plugin exists, problems it solves, and user value
3. **[systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md)** - Technical architecture, algorithms, and implementation patterns
4. **[techContext.md](./techContext.md)** - Development stack, dependencies, and technical constraints
5. **[activeContext.md](./activeContext.md)** - Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
6. **[progress.md](./progress.md)** - What works, current status, and evolution of decisions

## Project Summary

### What This Plugin Does
- **Core Innovation**: Transforms Obsidian's basic backlinks into "2nd order backlinks"
- **Key Feature**: Co-Citations analysis showing contextual relationships between notes
- **Analysis Types**: 4 different algorithms (Co-Citations, Similarity, Link Prediction, Community Detection)
- **User Value**: Reveals hidden patterns and relationships in knowledge vaults

### Technical Architecture
```
Obsidian Plugin → MyGraph → Analysis Algorithms → Svelte UI Components
```

### Current Status
- **Fully Functional**: All 4 analysis types implemented and working
- **Mature Codebase**: Version 0.15.4 with stable architecture
- **Community Plugin**: Available through Obsidian's plugin marketplace
- **No Active Development**: Feature-complete with optional enhancements possible

### Key Technologies
- **TypeScript** + **Svelte** for UI
- **Graphology** for graph operations
- **Obsidian API** for plugin integration
- **wink-nlp** for natural language processing

## Memory Bank Usage

### For New Development Sessions
1. Read **projectbrief.md** first to understand the core mission
2. Review **activeContext.md** for current state and priorities
3. Check **progress.md** to understand what's implemented
4. Reference **systemPatterns.md** and **techContext.md** for technical details

### For Feature Development
- **systemPatterns.md** contains architecture patterns for adding new algorithms
- **techContext.md** explains the development setup and constraints
- **progress.md** identifies potential enhancement opportunities

### For Bug Fixes or Maintenance
- **activeContext.md** documents current technical debt and known issues
- **systemPatterns.md** explains error handling and integration patterns
- **techContext.md** covers development workflow and testing approach

## Project Health
✅ **Stable and Complete** - No critical issues or missing features
✅ **Well Documented** - Comprehensive README and algorithm explanations
✅ **Active Community** - Established user base with positive feedback
✅ **Modern Stack** - Current dependencies and Obsidian API compatibility
