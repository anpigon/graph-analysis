# Product Context: Graph Analysis Plugin

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Obsidian's default backlinks panel only shows **where** notes are connected - which notes link to the current note. This provides limited insight into the **context** and **relationships** between ideas in a knowledge vault.

### The Solution
Graph Analysis transforms basic connectivity into intelligent relationship discovery by implementing mathematical graph algorithms that reveal:
- **Why** notes are connected (contextual relationships)
- **What** notes are connected with (co-occurrence patterns)
- **How similar** notes are based on their graph position
- **Which** notes should be connected (link prediction)
- **What communities** exist within the knowledge graph

## Core User Problems Solved

### 1. Daily Notes Context Loss
**Problem**: Users with daily notes see boring backlinks - just dates when topics were mentioned.
**Solution**: Co-Citations shows what topics are discussed together, revealing thematic connections across time.

### 2. Hidden Relationship Discovery
**Problem**: Users can't easily discover implicit relationships between notes.
**Solution**: Similarity and Link Prediction algorithms suggest connections based on graph structure.

### 3. Knowledge Vault Organization
**Problem**: Large vaults become difficult to navigate and understand structurally.
**Solution**: Community Detection reveals natural groupings and clusters of related content.

### 4. Research Workflow Enhancement
**Problem**: Researchers need to understand how concepts relate beyond direct links.
**Solution**: Co-Citations provides contextual sentences showing how ideas are discussed together.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Open Analysis View** - User opens the Graph Analysis panel
2. **Select Analysis Type** - Choose from Co-Citations, Similarity, Link Prediction, or Community Detection
3. **View Results Table** - See ranked list of related notes with numerical scores
4. **Explore Details** - Expand co-citation entries to see contextual sentences
5. **Navigate Insights** - Click through to explore discovered relationships

### Key Interactions
- **Table-based Results**: Clean, sortable interface showing note relationships
- **Expandable Details**: Co-citations show exact sentences where notes appear together
- **Hover Previews**: Quick note previews without leaving the analysis view
- **Contextual Navigation**: Direct links to related notes and their contexts

## Value Delivered

### For Daily Note Users
Transform date-based backlinks into thematic relationship discovery, showing how topics evolve and connect across journal entries.

### For Researchers
Provide academic-grade co-citation analysis to understand how concepts are discussed together in research notes.

### For Knowledge Workers
Reveal hidden patterns and suggest new connections to enhance knowledge discovery and synthesis.

### For Vault Organizers
Understand natural communities and clusters within large knowledge bases for better organization.

## Success Indicators
- Users discover previously unknown relationships between their notes
- Research workflows become more efficient through contextual insights
- Large vaults become more navigable through community detection
- Daily note users gain thematic insights beyond chronological organization
