## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Plugin Architecture Stability
- **Current State**: Well-established architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Key Strength**: Modular design allows for easy algorithm additions
- **Consideration**: Performance optimization opportunities exist for very large vaults

### Algorithm Implementation Status
- **Co-Citations**: Flagship feature fully implemented with contextual sentence extraction
- **Similarity**: Jaccard similarity working effectively
- **Link Prediction**: Both Adamic Adar and Common Neighbours implemented
- **Community Detection**: Label Propagation and Louvain algorithms functional

### UI/UX Current State
- **Table Interface**: Clean, sortable results presentation with outliner support
- **Expandable Details**: Co-citation context viewing with markdown rendering
- **Performance**: Infinite scroll handles large result sets
- **Integration**: Seamless Obsidian workspace integration
- **Accessibility**: Improved ordered lists and footnotes styling

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns
- **TypeScript First**: Strong typing throughout for maintainability
- **Svelte Components**: Reactive UI with clear component hierarchy
- **Graph Processing**: Centralized through MyGraph class extending graphology
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user notifications

### Development Preferences
- **Build System**: Rollup with TypeScript and Svelte integration
- **Package Management**: pnpm for efficient dependency handling
- **Version Control**: Standard-version for automated releases
- **Testing**: Manual testing in Obsidian development environment

### Performance Patterns
- **Graph Caching**: Build once, analyze multiple times approach
- **Lazy Loading**: UI components load content on demand
- **Memory Management**: Careful handling of large graph structures
- **Computation Optimization**: Algorithm efficiency considerations

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- **Graphology Integration**: Excellent choice for mathematical graph operations
- **Obsidian API Usage**: Effective use of metadata cache and workspace APIs
- **NLP Processing**: wink-nlp provides robust sentence extraction for co-citations
- **Component Architecture**: Svelte's reactivity works well for data-heavy interfaces

### User Experience Insights
- **Co-Citations Value**: Users find contextual relationships most valuable
- **Daily Notes Enhancement**: Transforms chronological backlinks into thematic insights
- **Research Workflow**: Academic users appreciate co-citation analysis depth
- **Large Vault Navigation**: Community detection helps organize complex knowledge bases

### Development Process Insights
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Proper metadata cache waiting prevents initialization issues
- **Algorithm Performance**: Some algorithms (Louvain) require performance considerations
- **UI Responsiveness**: Table-based presentation scales well with infinite scroll
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation maintains plugin functionality

## Current Technical Debt
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Web worker implementation needed for heavy computations (Louvain algorithm)
  - Main thread blocking during complex analyses
- **Incremental Updates**:
  - Graph rebuilding currently requires full reconstruction
  - Change detection mechanism needed for partial updates
- **Algorithm Expansion**:
  - Framework in place but requires new algorithm implementations
  - Potential additions: Betweenness centrality, PageRank
- **Mobile Optimization**:
  - UI adjustments for smaller screens
  - Performance tuning for mobile processors

## Integration Status
- **Obsidian Community**: Successfully integrated as community plugin
- **API Compatibility**: Current with Obsidian API requirements (min 0.12.10)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both desktop and mobile platforms
- **External Libraries**: All dependencies stable and well-maintained
