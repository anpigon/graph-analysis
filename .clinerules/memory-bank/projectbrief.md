# Project Brief: Graph Analysis Plugin for Obsidian

## Core Mission
Enhance Obsidian with advanced graph analysis capabilities that reveal hidden relationships and patterns within knowledge vaults through mathematical algorithms.

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Graph Analysis
- **Type**: Obsidian Plugin
- **Version**: 0.15.4
- **Author**: SkepticMystic
- **Status**: Mature, fully functional plugin

## Primary Value Proposition
Transform Obsidian's basic backlinks into intelligent relationship discovery through "2nd order backlinks" - showing not just WHERE notes are connected, but WHY and WITH WHAT they are connected.

## Core Features
1. **Co-Citations Analysis** - The flagship feature that counts and analyzes notes cited together
2. **Similarity Measurement** - Jaccard similarity based on graph connectedness
3. **Link Prediction** - Adamic Adar and Common Neighbours algorithms
4. **Community Detection** - Label Propagation and Clustering Coefficient algorithms

## Key Innovation
The Co-Citations algorithm serves as a "2nd order backlinks panel" that reveals contextual relationships by analyzing which notes are mentioned together and in what context, providing deeper insights than traditional backlink panels.

## Target Users
- Obsidian users with large, interconnected vaults
- Researchers and knowledge workers seeking pattern discovery
- Users of daily notes who want to understand thematic connections
- Anyone wanting to discover hidden relationships in their knowledge graph

## Success Metrics
- Reveals previously hidden note relationships
- Provides actionable insights for knowledge exploration
- Enhances understanding of vault structure and themes
- Supports research and discovery workflows

## Technical Approach
Mathematical graph analysis algorithms applied to Obsidian's note graph structure, presented through an intuitive table-based interface with expandable details.
